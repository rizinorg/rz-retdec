# rz-retdec

RetDec plugin for [Rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin).

The plugin integrates RetDec decompiler into Rizin console. rz-retdec is shipped with a bundled RetDec version, but you can use your own version (specified below).

With the bundled version of RetDec you can decompile the following architectures:
* 32-bit: Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.
* 64-bit: x86-64, ARM64 (AArch64).

### Use in Rizin Console

In rizin console you can type `pdz?` to print help:

```bash
Usage: pdz   # Native RetDec decompiler plugin.
| pdz      # Show decompilation result of current function.
| pdz*     # Show current decompiled function side by side with offsets.
| pdza[?]  # Run RetDec analysis.
| pdze     # Show environment variables.
| pdzj     # Dump current decompiled function as JSON.
| pdzo     # Show current decompiled function side by side with offsets.
```

The following environment variables may be used to dynamically customize the plugin's behavior:

```bash
$ export DEC_SAVE_DIR=<path> # custom path for output of decompilation to be saved to.
```

## Build and Installation

This section describes a local build and installation of rz-retdec.

### Requirements

* A compiler supporting c++17
* CMake (version >= 3.6)
* Existing Rizin installation
* Optional for Cutter: Existing Cutter installation

To build the bundled version of RetDec see [RetDec requirements section](https://github.com/avast/retdec#requirements).

### Process

* Clone the repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-retdec`
  * `cd rz-retdec`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local`
  * `make`
  * `make install`

You have to pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to set the installation path to `<path>`. It is important to set the `<path>` to a location where Rizin can load plugins from (for example `~/.local`).

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DBUILD_BUNDLED_RETDEC=ON` to build bundled RetDec version with the plugin. The build of the bundled RetDec is by default turned on. RetDec will be installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. When turned OFF system is searched for RetDec installation.
* `-DRZ_RETDEC_DOC=OFF` optional parameter to build Doxygen documentation.
* `-DBUILD_CUTTER_PLUGIN=OFF` setting to ON will build the Cutter plugin. This requires a cutter installation to be available. If it is not found automatically, you can pass the prefix with `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/cutter/prefix`.

*Note*: rz-retdec requires [filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) library to be linked with the plugin. CMake will try to find the library in the system but on GCC 7 it might not be able to do so automatically. In that case you must specify a path where this library is located in the system to the cmake by adding:
* `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${PATH_TO_FILESTSTEM_DIR}`

On GCC 7 is `stdc++fs` located in:
* `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/`
